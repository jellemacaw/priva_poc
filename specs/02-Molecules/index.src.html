<p>
  In chemistry, molecules are groups of atoms bonded together, which take on new properties as a result.

  In interfaces, molecules are groups of elements that function together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button atom can combine them together to form a search form molecule.

  Building up from atoms to molecules encourages a “do one thing and do it well” mentality, and encourages creating reusable interface patterns..
